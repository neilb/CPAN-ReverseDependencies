=head1 NAME

CPAN::ReverseDependencies - given a CPAN dist name, find other CPAN dists that use it

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use CPAN::ReverseDependencies qw/ get_reverse_dependencies /;

 my @deps = get_reverse_dependencies('Module-Path');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<CPAN::ReverseDependencies> exports a single function,
C<get_reverse_dependencies>,
which takes the name of a CPAN distribution and
returns a list containing names of other CPAN distributions that have declared
a dependence on the specified distribution.

It uses L<MetaCPAN::Client> to look up the reverse dependencies,
so obviously you have to be online for this module to work.
If you want more than just the name of the dependent distributions,
use L<MetaCPAN::Client> directly,
and get the info you need from the L<MetaCPAN::Client::Release>
objects returned by the C<reverse_dependencies> method.

This module will C<croak> in a number of situations:

=over 4

=item * If you request reverse dependencies for a non-existent distribution;

=item * If you're not online;

=item * If there's a problem with MetaCPAN itself.

=back

=head2 OO Interface

The first release had an OO interface, which is supported for backwards compatibility:

 use CPAN::ReverseDependencies;
 
 my $revua = CPAN::ReverseDependencies->new();
 my @deps  = $revua->get_reverse_dependencies('Module-Path');
